## 🚀 Key Features Added

### Query Builder Pattern
```python
# Before: Basic CRUD operations
orders = await client.orders.list()

# After: Powerful query building
recent_orders = await client.orders.with_filters(
    status="completed"
).created_after("2024-01-01").limit(50).all()
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```python
# Before: Generic exceptions
try:
    order = await client.orders.get("invalid_id")
except Exception as e:
    print("Something went wrong")

# After: Specific error types
try:
    order = await client.orders.get("invalid_id")
except StatesetAPIError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.message} (Status: {e.status_code})")
except StatesetRateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limited. Retry after: {e.retry_after}")
```

### Smart Retry Logic
```python
# Automatic retries with exponential backoff
retry_config = RetryConfig(
    max_retries=5,
    backoff_factor=1.0,
    retry_status_codes=(429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
)
client = Stateset(retry_config=retry_config)
```

### Advanced Filtering
```python
# Complex filtering capabilities
orders = await client.orders.with_filters(
    status="pending"
).created_after("2024-01-01").where(
    total_amount__gte=100.00
).sort_by("created", "desc").all()
```
